# AutoGAN

AutoGAN is a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network** which is trained to reproduce **realistic**, **high-quality** images of cars through the use of a **Generator** and **Discriminator**. The DCGAN itself was trained using **PyTorch** as well as **scikit-learn** for image processing. 

Here is a GIF of the model training over time:
